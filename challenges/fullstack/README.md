# Full Stack Coding Challenge

## Sales Campaign Management System

### Objective

Build a system where internal team members (e.g., marketing) can create, schedule, and manage Sales Campaigns.

### Requirements

- A Sales Campaign consists of:
  - Title (Ex: "New Year Sale")
  - Discount percentage (Ex: 20%)
  - Start and end date
- The system should allow users to:
  - View upcoming and past campaigns
  - Create new campaigns
- Data should be stored in MongoDB
- API can be GraphQL or REST

### Candidate Task

1. Design and implement the API
2. Build the frontend UI in React
3. Connect the frontend with the API
4. Persist campaign data in MongoDB

Optional:

- Allow campaigns to run only in specific countries
- Discuss how you would extend the functionality to:
  - allow the campaign title to be localized in multiple languages
  - support a different theme on the client-side for each sale campaign
- Suggest ideas on what you would do to enhance this feature in the future

### Notes

- The API design and database schema are not predefined; candidates should make these decisions.
- Focus on functionality first, and consider enhancements if time allows.
